✨ Features

Complete OAuth 2.0 Flow: Implements the full authorization code flow with PKCE
Security First: Uses state parameters and code challenges to prevent CSRF attacks
Modern UI: Clean, responsive design with Xero branding
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for various OAuth scenarios
Real-time Status: Visual feedback during the authentication process
Token Management: Secure handling and display of access tokens

🛠️ Setup
Prerequisites

A Xero developer account
A registered Xero application with OAuth 2.0 enabled

Configuration

Clone this repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/xero-oauth-integration.git
cd xero-oauth-integration

Configure your Xero app

Log into the Xero Developer Portal
Navigate to your app settings
Add your deployment URL as a redirect URI (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/xero-oauth-integration/)


Deploy

Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or
Host on your preferred platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)



Current Configuration

Client ID: C31C29D207AF4035B3ACF3F9B1A49D6C
Scopes: openid profile email accounting.read accounting.write
Redirect URI: Uses current page URL

🔧 How It Works

Authorization Request: User clicks "Connect to Xero" button
PKCE Generation: Creates secure code verifier and challenge
Xero Redirect: Redirects to Xero's authorization server
User Authentication: User logs into Xero and grants permissions
Callback Handling: Xero redirects back with authorization code
Token Exchange: Code is exchanged for access tokens
Success: Displays connection status and token information

🔐 Security Features

PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange): Enhanced security for OAuth flows
State Parameter Validation: Prevents CSRF attacks
Secure Token Handling: Tokens are processed securely
Session Storage: Temporary storage of OAuth parameters

📋 OAuth Flow Diagram
User → [Connect Button] → Generate PKCE → Xero Login → Authorization
  ↑                                                         ↓
Success ← Token Exchange ← Callback Handling ← User Consent
🎯 Usage
For End Users

Visit the application URL
Click the "Connect to Xero" button
Log into your Xero account
Grant the requested permissions
You'll be redirected back with a success confirmation

For Developers
The application demonstrates:

OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow implementation
PKCE security implementation

🚨 Important Notes
Security Considerations

Never expose client secrets in frontend code
Always use HTTPS in production
Validate all OAuth parameters on your backend
Store tokens securely (send to backend, not localStorage)

Production Deployment
For production use:

Move token handling to backend: Don't display tokens in the frontend
Implement proper token storage: Use secure, server-side storage
Add rate limiting: Protect against abuse
Enable HTTPS: Essential for OAuth security
Validate redirect URIs: Ensure they match your registered URIs

🔍 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Invalid redirect URI"

Ensure the redirect URI in Xero matches your deployment URL exactly
Check for trailing slashes and protocol (http vs https)

"Invalid client_id"

Verify the client ID matches your Xero app
Ensure the app is properly configured in Xero Developer Portal

"Access denied"

Check that required scopes are enabled in your Xero app
Ensure the user has permission to authorize the application

CORS errors

Make sure you're accessing the page via the proper domain
Ensure Xero has the correct redirect URI configured
